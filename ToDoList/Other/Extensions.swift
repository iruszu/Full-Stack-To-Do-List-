/// When you‚Äôre registering a new user in an app (like your ToDoList app), you probably want to save their info to Firestore or some other backend. Firestore typically expects data in the format of a [String: Any] dictionary. But in Swift, user models are often structs or classes.
///
///     1. Encodes the Swift object (like a User struct) into JSON Data.
///     2. Converts that data into a [String: Any] dictionary using JSONSerialization.
///     3. Returns that dictionary so you can use it when calling Firestore‚Äôs .setData() or .updateData() methods.

// What does JSON do for your app?

//  Your app uses JSON to talk to external services or save structured data (lightweight data format used to represent structured data) :
// ‚Ä¢    üß† Saving user data to Firebase Firestore
// ‚Ä¢    ‚òÅÔ∏è Sending info to a backend or getting info from an API
// ‚Ä¢    üì§ Uploading or downloading lists, settings, or anything structured
